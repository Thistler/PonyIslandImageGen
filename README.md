GreySky Gen
=======
As I am no longer actively maintaining this project, I have made the code public to anyone who wishes to update/modify it for themselves. The only requirement is that you keep the disclaimer about PI's image ownership intact, as this was a request made by PI to prevent the site from being mistaken for a free adopatable/ponysona/character generator.

## Running Locally
Download the project and open index.html in a browser. The image generator should work without any additional effort. To use the image converter, you will have to set up a dev environment. (XAMPP or similar)

## Adding Genes/Breeds
Open update_data.js and add the relevant data to the array lists at the top of the file. This will update the dropdowns, randomizer, etc.
